# Problem Statement

## Current situation
The customer support team are utilising a manual ticketing system to manage incoming requests. The agents triage, categorise, and prioritise tickets individually resulting in delays to categorising, assignment and resolution.

## Problem
- Average ticket resolution times frequently exceed SLA targets (estimate 30% - 40% of tickets).
- Negative feedback from customers due to long response time.
- Support Managers lack visibility on recurring tickets and ticket trends.
- Repetitive, low priority tickets consume significant agent time, reducing capacity for complex issues.

## Impact:
- **Business:** SLA breaches, increased operational costs, and customer dissatisfaction.
- **Customers:** Frustration, reduced trust in support services, and delays in issue resolution.
- **Team:** Lower morale, higher workload and risk of burnout amongst agents.

## Opportunity:
Optimising the ticketing workflow presents the opportunity to:
- Automate repetitive processes to improve efficiency.
- Improve ticket categorisation and prioritisation.
- Reduce SLA breaches and reduce resolution times.
- Improve customer satisfaction and agent efficiency.
